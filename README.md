# stress detection in IT professionals using machine learning
The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered people’s perspectives on healthcare constraints and lifestyles. With the widespread impact of the virus, educational institutions worldwide closed to curb the disease’s spread, affecting food availability and medical facilities. Surveys have shown that stress levels have increased due to concerns about job security, family health, and academic performance. Prolonged work hours and tight deadlines further exacerbate stress, leading to heart and muscle-related issues.
This project aims to create a model for predicting stress levels in IT professionals using machine learning algorithms and data science techniques. By monitoring various psychological parameters, the model will categorize individuals based on their stress levels, providing insights for personalized stress management. The goal is to offer a proactive approach to mental health, helping IT professionals manage stress effectively and improve their overall well-being. So for this to be done, some Machine Learning algorithms and Data Science techniques are used. Maintaining track records of each IT professional stress levels, and studying those makes us understand the degrees of stress of the individual in the organization. The IT professionals are categorized into sub levels in regards with the stress percentage they face i.e., over-stressed or under- stressed. And according to that, the range of stress is highlighted based on the levels. Based on this percentage, the authorities give advice to the Individual. 
As a result, a model for unlabeled data and untrained data that will determine the stress level of IT professionals using different Machine Learning and data science techniques. Additionally, providing personalized suggestions based on stress levels, such as taking short breaks, practicing mindfulness, or seeking counseling, can further aid in effective stress management.
